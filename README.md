# DNJSheetMaker
A simple program that'll create a DNJ (Dungeon's and JJBA) sheet from scratch and format it for usage.

HOW TO USE:
1. Download IntelliJ (Link can be found here; other download types can be found on the website. MAKE SURE YOU GET THE COMMUNITY ADDITION!!!): https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows
2. Open IntelliJ
3. Click on the button that says 'Open' in the IntelliJ home
4. Choose the "dnd sheet creator" file (Should be embedded inside of this folder; make sure you actually download the github file of DNJSheetMaker smh)
5. At the top of the screen, click the 'File' button and then click 'Project Structure'.
6. In the project tab next to the label 'SDK', click the drop down and hit 'Add SDK'. Then select 'JDK'. In the second dropdown menu that says 'language level', make sure it is 18 - No new Language features. # This is VERY IMPORTANT.
7. (If you're not already there) In the left sidebar, go to src, double click it, and then double click on Main.Java
8. Press the green play button in the top-right corner of the screen to execute the program.
9. Copy the information from the terminal once the program has finished. Note that it does NOT save once the program is closed.

Enjoy your new character sheet :]
